3.	National Crime Bureau in India

The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) is an Indian government body that collects and analyses crime data as defined by the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Special and Local Laws (SLL). NCRB is part of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) of the Government of India and has its headquarters in New Delhi. 
The National Crime Reporting Bureau (NCRB) was established in 1986 to serve as a storehouse of information on crime and offenders to aid detectives in connecting crime to perpetrators. The Directorate of Coordination and Police Computer (DCPC), Inter-State Criminals Data Branch of the CBI, and Central Finger Print Bureau of the CBI were merged on the recommendations of the Task Force in 1985 and the National Police Commission in 1977.
According to the National Crime Records Bureau, India’s crime rate (crime incidence per 100,000 people) went from 383.5 in 2018 to 385.5 in 2019 to 383.8 in 2020. COVID-19-related limitations and infractions have been blamed for the increase in crime in 2020.

5.     Major Crime Categories and Trend
 
Major crime rate categories and trends provide valuable insights into the prevailing criminal landscape. In India, these categories encompass a range of offenses. Homicide, assault, theft, robbery, and sexual offenses are among the prominent crime categories. Trends in these categories can shed light on changing patterns and methods employed by criminals. For example, the rise of cybercrime crime rate and its various forms, such as online fraud and identity theft, is a notable trend in recent years. Additionally, crimes against women and children, including sexual assault and child abuse. [Data released](http://ncrb.gov.in/) by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) this week shows a 69% decadal (over the decade) jump in crimes against women. The number of kidnappings and abductions of women and girls have jumped a whopping 163.8% since 2002.
Violent crimes or crimes that fall under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) have jumped about 34% over the last 10 years, from about 1.7 million in 2002 to 2.4 million in 2012. On an annual basis, violent crimes rose 3% from the previous year’s 2.3 million.
Increase in the cases disposed of by the Police due to lack of evidence. A common trend across various crimes under IPC and SLL is the increase in the share of cases closed by the police without filing the charge sheet.  As highlighted earlier, police filed the final report (without filing a charge sheet) in bulk of the cases like ‘Theft and Robbery’ because of non-availability of evidence.

A higher share of cases which cause bodily harm like accidents, riots, rape, causing death etc are charge-sheeted by the police and sent for court trial. Closure of cases for lack of evidence points to serious issues in the investigation process and with the investigative agencies. Factors like – lack of personnel, lack of resources etc could be influencing such increasing trends.

6.	Impacts of Crime on Society and Economy

The impacts of crime on society and the economy are far-reaching and multifaceted. In society, crime engenders feelings of fear, mistrust, and insecurity among individuals, leading to a diminished quality of life. Communities affected by high crime rates often suffer from a breakdown in social cohesion, increased isolation, and a decline in community engagement. Moreover, crime can have devastating consequences for the victims and their families, causing physical and psychological trauma that can persist for years.
Economically, the crime rate poses a significant burden. It results in increased healthcare costs, loss of productivity, and expenses related to law enforcement and the criminal justice system. Additionally, crime deters investments, hampers economic growth, and tarnishes a country’s reputation, impacting tourism and foreign direct investment. Therefore, addressing crime is crucial for fostering a safer society and a thriving economy.

7.	Conclusion

We can conclude that the annual crime rates are not following any specific trend line. Line graph shows there have been high irregularity and thus, a smooth curve line is not formed. 
It is clear from this those states having higher literacy rate, the number of crimes in that state is also high. In a state where the literacy rate is low, the number of criminal cases ate also less in that state. Educated persons are more involved in crimes than illiterate persons. The number of crimes or crimes should not be linked to literacy rate or education, but the figures are telling the story. If we assess the state’s population, literacy rate and the number of crimes, then we will find that in a state where the percentage of literacy is higher, the numbers of crimes are also higher. Somewhere education without focus on Indian values and culture is responsible.
